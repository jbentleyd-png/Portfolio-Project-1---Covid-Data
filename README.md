# COVID-19 Data Analysis with MySQL

This project uses **MySQL** for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on two datasets:
- `CovidDeaths.csv`
- `CovidVaccinations.csv`

The data includes global COVID-19 case counts, deaths, population, and vaccination rates.

## Project Structure

**Data Cleaning**  
  Cleans raw CSV data:
  - Handles NULLs and inconsistent inputs  
  - Forces columns into correct data types  
  - Prepares the dataset for reliable analysis  

**Exploratory Queries (Section 1.2)**  
  Exploratory analysis of the `CovidDeaths` table:  
  - Ratios of infections to deaths by country  
  - Comparisons across continents  
  - Other high-level insights  

**Advanced Analysis (Section 1.3)**  
  Showcases more advanced SQL techniques:  
  - Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
  - Window functions for running totals  
  - Temporary tables for intermediate calculations  
  - Inner joins combining deaths and vaccination data
